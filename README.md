## Property Data

- Sample property data is exported as `PROPERTYLISTINGSAMPLE` in `constants/index.ts`.
- Each property includes:
  - `name`, `address` (city/state/country), `rating`
  - `category`, `price`, `offers` (bed, shower, occupants)
  - `image` URL, `discount` if any.

**Example:**
```ts
export const PROPERTYLISTINGSAMPLE: PropertyProps[] = [
  {
    name: "Villa Ocean Breeze",
    address: { state: "Seminyak", city: "Bali", country: "Indonesia" },
    rating: 4.89,
    category: ["Luxury Villa", "Pool", "Free Parking"],
    price: 3200,
    offers: { bed: "3", shower: "3", occupants: "4-6" },
    image: "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
    discount: ""
  },
